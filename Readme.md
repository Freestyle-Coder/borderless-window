# Borderlesser

Play all your Games in Borderless, Fullscreen, Windowed or whatevs.
If you don't want the fancy configuration options, just ignore them. the Defaults should be fine for borderless gaming (but i do recommend turning autostart on)).

## Installation

Just extract the zip in your Programs Folder or somewhere else i don't care. It should be noted that its not a single file anymore so your desktop prolly isn't the right place.

Also if you want to move it later, you need to turn autostart off and on again to register the new executable path.

## Usage

Just set a hotkey and optionally a modifier and close it. It will go in your tray where you can either double click to open the configuration window again or just leave and ignore it.

The from and to XY values set the size and position of the window. E.x.: FromXY (1920, 0) ToXY (3840, 1080) makes it cover the second screen. If its still not clear look at the image below.
